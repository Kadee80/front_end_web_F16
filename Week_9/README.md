# Midterm Presentations

Today and Wednesday you will be presenting your midterm website projects. 

Your design and presentation is long part of your grade. I will be looking through your source code on github later this week. Be sure to have a visible folder labeled midterm in your repository with your source code by THIS COMING FRIDAY. Within your midterm folder, add a  README.md file containing a link to the live hosted site, and a second link to your documentation.

You can add links with markdown as follows:

```
[The Link Title A User Sees](http://theURLtoLINKto.com)
```

Before we begin, lets take a look at the Shuffle_Student folder to see how we will be chosing a random order for our presentations today and Wednesday. After we generate a list together, the order will be posted below.
