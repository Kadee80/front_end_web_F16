# Final Presentations

Today will be presenting your final website projects. 

Your design and presentation is long part of your grade. I will be looking through your source code on github later this week. *Be sure to have a visible folder labeled final in your repository with your source code by THIS COMING WEDNESDAY*. Within your final folder, add a  README.md file containing a link to the live hosted site, and a second link to your documentation.

You can add links with markdown as follows:

```
[The Link Title A User Sees](http://theURLtoLINKto.com)

1. In class presentation.
2. Provide source code and link to live site in GitHub.
