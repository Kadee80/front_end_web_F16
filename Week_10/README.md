# HW Due Monday of Week 11

This week we are going to dive into Boostrap, but just to make sure we have a grasp of basic data types, functions, and conditional statements. 

## OPTION 1:
Take a look at your midterm and see if there is somewhere you might be able to apply a little javascript. Add some javascript to your midterm.

## OPTION 2:
Make something totally new. A calculator, a timer, and image toggler...ANYTHING! Maybe flex your bootstrap muscles and make it look cool.
