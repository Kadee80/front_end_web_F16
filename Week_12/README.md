# Final Project Proposals

Today all 19 of you will be presenting your final project proposals. 

* I will be giving feedback on the scope of your project and letting you know if it is an acceptable size for a final project.

* Suggesting libraries and frameworks that might help you accomplish your project.

* Planning possible future class lessons based on the needs presented today.

### For your proposal to be counted as complete you must:

1- Present in class, either your blog post or slide presentation.

2- Submit a blog post and provide me with a link either via github or email.

### REMINDER - We do not have class Wednesday due to Thanksgiving break. Rest up and enjoy!
