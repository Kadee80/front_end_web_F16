###HOMEWORK:

Make sure you have all software set up for next class. We won’t be using photoshop for a few weeks but please inquire about the student discounts.

Get your blog/server space set up.

You can receive web server space from IDM’s Technology Manager, Elton Kwok, MAGNET 883 or if you already have your own that works too. Please [email him](mailto:eltonkwok@nyu.edu) for an appointment (plan on it taking 30 minutes).
IDM’s FTP server info: http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu (Use active mode)
If you have your own server space set up already that is also ok.
IMPORTANT! – Leave your name prefered email and link to your blog once it is set up in the comment section of this post. This is how I will be checking your assignments/progress in the future.

**Documentation is 5% of your grade at IDM.**
