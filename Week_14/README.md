# HW - Keep working on your finals.

Final presentations will be Monday Dec 19th in our classroom at scheduled class time.

*Email me if you prefer to present Wednesday Dec 14.*

**Tuesday Dec 13 is a legislative day. This means classes meet according to a Monday schedule. Rather than have 3 classes in a row this week, I will open up class time for [scheduled office hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUNXcDRjZFIwTXZDfGRlZmF1bHR8NDkzNWVkOWUxNGI3M2FkZTJlYTY0YjU0ZmRiNjJiYTE) for work with finals. Same with Wednesday Dec 14, the first half hour of appointments will be for optional early final presentations. More on this next week**
